#
# EXAMPLE FILE:
# This docker-compose file contains example services for LND and BTC. This
# file can be used directly to setup your application for use w/ the lnd-engine.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - Available ports for a specific service are located in its applicable Dockerfile.
#   However, nothing is bound to the host
# - All cert generation happens within the Dockerfiles
# - /shared directory is used between local services for sharing of public keys
#   however in a production setting, this setup would need to change
#
# The official LND docker setup can be found here:
# https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/docker
